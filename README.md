# waterc
waterc is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to control and monitor AORUS water coolers on Linux systems. Official AORUS software does not support Linux, so this tool provides essential functionality for managing fan and pump modes, curves, speeds, and real-time monitoring. It was reverse-engineered on the AORUS cooler library.
